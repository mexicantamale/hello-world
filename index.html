		<h1>Article 1: Trying to Keep the Internet Safe</h1>
		<h3>Trump 1</h3>
		<p>Source: Aclu</p>


<p>Summary:Due to the fact that there are so many violent people in the world, the U.S government wants to expand the phone calls and email search to see if anybody is having contact with the muslims and inviting the russians.Next President for 2017(Donald Trump) gave his approval in expanding security searches.But the rest of the world does not approve to this so called change.</p>


<p>Memorable Quote: “ The NSA has almost certainly searched through the contents of your communications — and it has done so without a warrant”.says Ashley Gorski, Staff Attorney, who works for ACLU National Security Project.</p>

<p>My Opinion: I believe that they might have laws that protect what they want to do but the real question here is are we really free anymore if they want to go through are personal messages,emails,and calls.?</p>
